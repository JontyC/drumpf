*Make News Real Again — Safari Extension*

## About

This extension was originally created to *[Make Donald Drumpf Again](https://youtu.be/DnpO_RTSNmQ?t=20m4s)*, but that's not funny anymore because it's real and everything is [completely](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/10/trump-intends-to-follow-up-botched-yemen-military-raid-by-helping-saudis-target-civilians/) [fucked up](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/magnitude-of-trump-adviser-flynn-s-russia-scandal-gains-clarity-874908739801) and [terrifying](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.xwrbfrj7o). 

Now, this extension will *Make News Real Again* by describing Trump accurately in the news. 

It will replace words and phrases like this: 

> *President Trump* <br/>
> *Donald Trump* <br/>
> *Trump's Administration* <br/>
> *President Donald Trump* <br/>

With more accurate words and phrases like this:

> *Turncoat Donald Trump* <br/>
> *Predator of the United States Trump* <br/>
> *Agent of Russia Donald Trump* <br/>
> *Nazi Trump's Administration* <br/>
> *Sexual Predator Trump* <br/>
> *Fascist in Chief Donald Trump* <br/>
> *White supremacist Trump* <br/>
> *Child murderer Donald Trump* <br/>
